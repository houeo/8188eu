## Overview
Used to deploy vless+websocket+tls on Heroku, and automatically select the latest alpine linux and Xray core for each deployment.
vless has better performance and takes up less resources.

Use xray +caddy to deploy protocols such as vmess vless trojan shadowsocks socks transmitted via ws at the same time, and the camouflage website has been configured by default.
Support tor network, and you can start xray and caddy through a custom network configuration file to configure various functions on demand
Supports storage of custom files. Both directories and account passwords are UUID. The client must use TLS to connect to
Heroku. It provides us with a free container service. We should not abuse it, so this project should not be used as a long-term circumvention.
